# Windows 11 (ExaGear)
### ExaGear with real Windows 11 surface

Since I noticed that the required files from "Master Lu" no longer seem to be available on the Internet, I'm uploading them here again.

[ExaGear Windows 11 v0.2.4.apk](https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windows_11-ExaGear/releases/download/v0.2.4%2F30/ExaGear.PC_0.2.4.apk)
[main.30.com.ludashi.benchmark.obb](https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windows_11-ExaGear/releases/download/v0.2.4%2F30/main.30.com.ludashi.benchmark.obb)


### How do you install this?

After installing the apk file, move the obb file you just downloaded in the internal storage to the path
**Android/obb/com.ludashi.benchmark/**

You may need to create the path first. You can then start the installed app. The app is only in Chinese but is still quite intuitive to use.

### Alternatives

If you value a different language or are bothered by the fact that due to the Windows 11 interface you cannot call Winecfg to switch Wine to Windows 10 functions (it simulates a Windows XP substructure), try [Windroid 11](https://github.com/Android-PowerUser/Windroid_11) for Android that uses the current Wine-stable-v8.0.0 and supports Linux applications.

If instead you don't value an up-to-date interface and you like playing Windows games, you can also use [Box64Droid](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box64Droid) with a Windows 98 design.


#### Why now?

123pan.com is no longer online and the required obb file has apparently not been available for download for a long time.

#### Miscellaneous

There is also the version main.31.com.ludashi.benchmark.obb, which can no longer be found either. But it still works that way.

You could upload them if you have them.
